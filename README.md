For this project you will be developing an MVC application that uses multiple models and foreign keys to model a relationship. You have the choice to develop either a Technology Review site or a Travel Review site.

Skills Required

Intro to MVC

Tasks

 Create the following models
 Review
 Category
Note: Your Review model should have properties to properly represent all the fields you feel need represented in a review. This may include:
 ID
 Title
 Content
 Publish Date
 Etc
 Content Requirements
 Homepage (AKA Index.html inside your Home folder in Views)
Include a title for your website and a brief description. You can use lorem ipsum.
 Reviews Index
Display all reviews. Experiment with different ways of presenting the reviews. Follow the example provided in Greatest Movies to customize your view with a layout other than the typical table layout.
 Reviews Details
Attempt to make the Details View look like an Article or Card on a review site like Yelp. Customize styling so it is not default table layout in the Details View.
 Styling requirements (For the Review views ONLY. Do not style the Category views)

 Reviews Index
 Reviews Details
Note: Use what we’ve learned regarding CSS and Bootstrap to style the pages to your liking. Pages should no longer look like basic Bootstrap. Do not worry about styling the Create, Edit and Delete views initially.
 Bootstrap Requirements
 Navbar
User should be able to navigate to the Reviews Index and Categories Index from the homepage
 Row(s)
 Columns
 Populate Categories table and Reviews table
Recommended: Three categories

 Documentation
 Program should be commented throughout explaining the code
Details

You should have at least two models and a foreign key relationship. Review the Bookshelf for an example of a foreign key relationship. You should be able to view the styled home page, navigate to the reviews index, click a review and view a styled detail page.

After your app is created, we recommend populating the Categories table with at least 3 categories, and your Reviews table with at least 3 mock reviews. Feel free to fill them out Lorem Ipsum.

Stretch Tasks

 Add Unique images for each review (HINT: Include a property in your Model to hold the image URL)
 Style the Edit, Create, and Delete pages
